# 🌐 Jaime Garrido – Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects in **graphics programming**, **engine development**, and **game technology**.

Built to highlight both **technical depth** and **visual presentation**, the site features a collection of academic and personal projects, each with its own dedicated page, media gallery, and technical breakdown.

## 🧠 Overview

The portfolio includes a variety of projects developed in **C++, OpenGL, Unity, and PlayStation 5 (devkit)** — all focused on real-time graphics, engine architecture, and performance-oriented rendering.

Each page is fully responsive, optimised for SEO, and built with clean HTML/CSS and vanilla JS for maximum performance on GitHub Pages.  
The base structure was originally adapted from the **Phantom** template by **[HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/phantom)**, later heavily customised and expanded to fit my design and technical requirements.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎯 Distance Based Interior Mapping (DBIP)
Custom **C++ OpenGL** implementation combining **Interior Mapping** with **Level of Detail (LOD)** to balance visual fidelity and performance.  
Includes parallax cubemap projection, real vs fake geometry comparisons, and performance benchmarks.

### 🕹️ GUSSI Engine
A full **OpenGL engine** written in C++, featuring a custom ECS, deferred + forward rendering, ImGui editor, multithreaded job system, and advanced post-processing.

### 🧩 PS5 Devkit Project – Che22
A strategy game built on **Sony’s PlayStation 5 API**, developed in a custom C++ engine.  
Focus on **data-oriented rendering**, procedural post-processing, and TRC compliance.

### 🏀 Encestoide
A polished **Unity prototype** focused on precision-based basketball mechanics, Cinemachine cameras, and fluid character control.

### 🚗 Carromaton
Dual-joystick **drift racing game** in Unity, featuring stylised environments, Cinemachine transitions, and a unique two-stick control scheme.

### 💧 Fluid Simulation (SPH)
2D **C++/Direct2D** fluid simulation using **multi-threaded Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics**, thread pools, and real-time interaction.

### 🦎 Procedural Salamander AI
Team project in **C++ with Raylib**, exploring **inverse kinematics**, **procedural animation**, and **reactive AI**.

### 👾 Galaxian Remake
Remake of the arcade classic written in **C**, using a 2D sprite library with intro cinematics, convoy attack logic, and a custom scoring system.
